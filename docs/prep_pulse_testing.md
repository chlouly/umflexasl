# Validation testing on pre-cooked prep pulses

This documentation contains results from validation testing of the following prep pulses (not defined by user ASL prep):
1. [Pre-saturation pulse](#pre-saturation-pulse-testing)
2. [Background suppression pulse](#background-suppression-pulse-testing)
3. [Fat saturation pulse](#fat-saturation-pulse-testing)

## Pre-saturation pulse testing
#### Experimental setup and hypothesis
Hypothesis: If we play a pre-saturation pulse directly before an SPGR echo train, we should observe a standard saturation recovery curve across the FIDs

## Background suppression pulse testing
Hypothesis: If we play a background suppression pulse directly before an SPGR echo train, we should observe a standard inversion recovery curve across the FIDs

## Fat saturation pulse testing
Hypothesis: If we play a fat saturation pulse directly before the TurboFLASH readout, we should see fat eliminated from the image
