## Introduction

### Pulse Sequence

#### Basic Sequence Control

##### Looping Structure
The main sequence follows a looping structure over three readout dimensions: frames, shots (through-plane interleaves), and arms (in-plane interleaves), ordered from fastest to slowest, respectively. Each frame contains all preparation pulses, delay times, and the readout echo train. [The entire kspace volume is encoded](#kspace-encoding-scheme) between the echo train, shots, and arms dimensions.

| Variable | Description | Controlled by |
| - | - | - |
| M | number of frames | cv: `nframes` |
| N | number of shots | cv: `opnshots` |
| P | number of arms | cv: `narms` |
| Shot interval | - | cv: `optr` |
| Sequence duration | - | n/a |

##### Kspace encoding scheme
This sequence uses 3D stack of spirals and spiral projection imaging (SPI) to encode kspace.
An initial 2D [variable-density spiral](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5925197_Fast_3D_imaging_using_variable-density_spiral_trajectories_with_applications_to_limb_perfusion) is generated and then transformed in 3D using rotation matrices.
Each readout dimension also transforms the kspace trajectory such that each frame contains all information for a single volume in kspace.
Each arm interleaves the initial 2D spiral in-plane by uniform rotations as shown on the left of the figure below.
Each shot interleaves the projected spiral volume acquired in a single echo echo train. For stack of spirals, this looks like through-plane interleaving along z as shown in the top right of the figure below. For spiral projection imaging, this will interleave the 3D rotations as shown in the bottom right of the figure below.
