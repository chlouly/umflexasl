written by David Frey for fMRI lab at University of Michigan, PI: Luis Hernandez-Garcia

Welcome to our asl3dflex project repository. In this project, we create a end-end pipeline for pulse sequence development and image reconstruction for velocity-selective ASL using a flexible spiral projection readout.

## Introduction

### Directory Structure
This repository contains several subpackages aimed at different aspects of MRI sequence development and data reconstruction. 

- `/psdsrc`: Contains GE pulse sequence source code.
- `/recon`: Contains MATLAB scripts for reconstructing MRI data.
- `/scanner`: Contains a library of bash scripts and pulse .txt files used for scanning.
